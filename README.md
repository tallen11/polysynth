# Polyphonic Midi Synth

* Polyphonic, subtractive midi synthesizer using PortAudio and RTMidi. It's got oscillators, filters, LFOs and at least 8 voices of polyphony.
* Uses wavetables. Currently can generate sine, sawtooth, square, and triangle (sort of) wave forms.
* Is currently being made into a VST plugin.

### TODO

* Generate band-limited tables to avoid aliasing
